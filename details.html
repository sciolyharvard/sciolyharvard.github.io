    <h1>Tournament Information</h1><br>
    <h4 class="w3-padding-30"><b>Parking</b></h4>
    <h5>Due to space constraints, bus parking will not be available; teams are responsible for arranging their own parking.  As our event takes place on a Sunday, street parking in the City of Cambridge will be free of charge. Individuals can also purchase a full-day Harvard garage parking pass <a href="http://www.transportation.harvard.edu/parking/visitors/online-daily-permits">here</a>.</h5><br>

    <h4 class="w3-padding-30"><b>Team Home Rooms</b></h4>
    <h5>Each team will be assigned a home room in Sever Hall. These rooms will be released one week before the tournament. Teams may be assigned to share a home base if necessary.</h5><br>


      <h4 class="w3-padding-30"><b>Pre-Ordered Lunch</b>: Order by Mon, 1/15</h4>
      <h5> Boxed lunches are available for pre-order online by coaches for $10/student for their teams.  Lunch vouchers will be distributed to coaches the morning of the tournament and can be redeemed for one box lunch each between the hours of 11am-2pm.  We highly recommend pre-ordering box lunches as restaurants in Harvard Square are often expensive and difficult to order for groups. Please place an order <a href="https://squareup.com/store/sciolyharvard/">here</a>. <b>Please note that students should not pre-order their own lunches. This should be done by coaches.</b></h5><br>

    <h5><ol type="1">
      <li>All students participating in Forensics and Chemistry Lab will be required to attend a 1-hour training session led by Harvard teaching staff from 7:00am-8:00am. More information about this will be sent to coaches prior to the tournament.</li>
      <li>Students participating in Forensics and Chemistry lab will <b>not</b> be allowed to bring any materials into the event. All materials necessary to complete the events will be provided by the Harvard Teaching Labs.</li>
      <li> Students participating in Forensics and Chemistry Lab must conform to the attire requirements below. For simplicity sake, we recommend all students wear long sleeves, jeans, long socks, and running shoes. The official policy is summarized here: Students must wear long sleeves, long durable pants (yoga pants and leggings will not be permitted), and closed-toe shoes. The Harvard Teaching Labs have a <b>"No Ankle Policy"</b>; this means socks worn must be long enough to cover exposed ankles. Furthermore, if boots are worn, the students' pants must be able to slip over the boots.</li>
      <li>Students participating in Game On may not bring any notes or external resources to the event.</li>
      <li>Images of the Helicopters room can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ejkmTPAt7C_5hP6eD0UT4DSG98lVMOpI">here</a>. The tables will be removed for tournament day.
