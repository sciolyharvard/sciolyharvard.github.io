    <h5>Teams may check-in no earlier than 6:45am, and no later than 8:00 am at Sever Hall in Harvard Yard. Check-in must be done by the coach listed as the main contact. This is the coach who registered for the invitational in September, and the coach who has been receiving all of our emails. </h5><Br>

    <h3><b>Vehicle Pick-up/Drop-off</b></h3>
    <h5>Harvard Squareâ€™s <b>bus drop off/pick up </b> zone is located on Mount Auburn Street, between Holyoke Street and Plympton Street. There is a 15 minute limit to park at this location, so please plan drop-off/pick up procedures accordingly. Convenient pick-up/drop-off sites near Harvard Yard for <b>standard (non-bus) vehicles</b> include along Oxford Street next to the Science Center or along Quincy Street besides the Harvard Art Museum. We would appreciate it if teams can be as quick and efficient with student pick-up/drop-off as possible to limit street traffic.</h5><br>

    <h3><b>Vehicle Parking</b></h3>
    <h5>An all-day Sunday parking permit for Harvard-affiliated parking lots can be purchased for $8.00 per vehicle. Please purchase these <b><a href="https://onedaypermit.vpcs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/permit/purchase.pl">at this link</a></b>. Finding on-street or garage parking in Harvard Square can be difficult and requires a pre-purchased parking permit, so please plan in advance. For more information about standard parking options around Harvard, please refer to the <b><a href="http://www.transportation.harvard.edu/parking/visitors">Harvard Transportation Website</a></b>. <b>For schools driving buses</b>, buses should proceed to free parking lots at 65 Waverly Street Lot and 195 Albany Street lot in Cambridge, MA (approximately 15 minutes drive) after dropping students off on Mt. Auburn Street.</h5></br>

    <h3>Map of Harvard Campus</h3>
<h5> Please download our official tournament map <b><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kWGoEugOEb3GltzCAeI2Iw-4UZwAF3pC">at this link</a></b>. We recommend all students have a printed copy of this map easily accessible during the tournament.

The Harvard Teaching Labs have a <b>"No Ankle Policy"</b>; this means socks worn must be long enough to cover exposed ankles. Furthermore, if boots are worn, the students' pants must be able to slip over the boots.</li>
      <li>Students participating in Game On may not bring any notes or external resources to the event.</li>
